## Introduction

**ASIC** stands for **Application-Specific Integrated Circuit**. An **ASIC** is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is designed for a specific application or purpose. Unlike general-purpose ICs such as microprocessors or memory chips, which are designed to perform a wide range of functions, **ASICs** are tailored to perform a single function or a set of closely related functions efficiently.
